# JARVIS Oilfield Development Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the well planning strategy devised by TRENCH Oil Company for the development of the JARVIS Oilfield off the coast of Tanzania. The field holds substantial reserves, with an estimated 390 million barrels and a potential of reaching 2.0 billion barrels. The development plan involves the drilling of four production wells, utilizing a floating, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel for offshore production.

## Objectives

- Design and optimize four production wells to efficiently extract oil from two distinct layers within the reservoir.
- Conduct various analyses and sensitivity tests to ensure maximum productivity and longevity of the production wells.
- Develop a comprehensive well planning strategy to address challenges and opportunities presented by the offshore location and reservoir characteristics.

## Key Considerations

1. **Reservoir Dynamics**: Understanding complex reservoir characteristics to optimize production strategies.
2. **Technical Configuration**: Selecting optimal completion configurations and equipment to ensure efficient oil recovery and operational integrity.
3. **Operational Flexibility**: Managing transportation logistics for oil, gas, and water disposal in an offshore environment.
4. **Long-Term Sustainability**: Implementing strategies to mitigate risks and ensure the longevity and profitability of the production wells over a planned 20-year lifespan.

## Analyses and Sensitivity Tests

- **Production Tubing Size Optimization**: Evaluating different tubing sizes to determine the optimal size for maximum productivity.
- **Gas-Liquid Ratio (GLR) Sensitivity Analysis**: Assessing the impact of changing GLR on production rates and bottom hole pressures.
- **Water Cut (WC) Sensitivity Analysis**: Investigating the effects of increasing water production on well performance and recommending strategies to mitigate water breakthrough.
- **Reservoir Depletion Sensitivity Analysis**: Analyzing the impact of reservoir depletion on production performance and determining abandonment pressures.
- **Skin Factor Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluating the effect of formation damage on productivity and identifying wells in need of stimulation.
- **Wellhead Pressure Sensitivity Analysis**: Assessing the influence of wellhead pressure on performance and recommending optimal pressure settings.

## Methodology

- Utilized the Darcy Reservoir model and multilayer pressure loss model for comprehensive analysis.
- Employed Prosper software for data collection and Python for further analysis and visualization.
- Generated detailed graphs and insights to justify well optimization decisions.

## Results and Recommendations

- **Optimized Production Efficiency**: Detailed findings on tubing size, GLR, WC, reservoir depletion, skin factor, and wellhead pressure.
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Recommendations for reservoir management and completion techniques to delay increases in WC and GLR.
- **Long-Term Success**: Strategies to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the JARVIS Oilfield development project.

## Conclusion

The comprehensive well planning strategy and detailed analyses outlined in this project aim to optimize production efficiency, mitigate risks, and ensure the long-term success of the JARVIS Oilfield development. By implementing the recommended strategies, TRENCH Oil Company can effectively navigate the complexities of offshore oil production and maximize the potential of this valuable resource.
